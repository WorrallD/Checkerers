# Checkers with Powerups Design Document

This document details the design for a variation of the classic game of Checkers, enhanced with the addition of powerups.

The basic rules of Checkers will remain the same: players take turns moving their pieces diagonally, with the objective to capture all of the opponent's pieces. However, powerups will add an extra layer of strategy and complexity.

Powerups will be randomly placed on the board at the beginning of the game, and players can collect them by moving their pieces over them. Each powerup will have a unique effect, such as allowing a piece to move additional squares, jump over multiple pieces, or even remove an opponent's piece from the board.

The game will require players to think carefully about how to best use their powerups, adding an additional layer of strategy to the game.
